"""
Purpose: Factory function to create debug agents with runtime inspection capabilities for AI-powered exception analysis
LLM-Note:
  Dependencies: imports from [pathlib, ../agent.py, runtime_inspector.py] | imported by [__init__.py, auto_debug_exception.py] | tested by [tests/test_debug_agent.py]
  Data flow: auto_debug_exception() calls create_debug_agent(frame, traceback, model) -> creates RuntimeInspector(frame, traceback) -> loads system prompt from prompts/debug_assistant.md -> creates Agent with inspector as tool -> returns Agent configured for debugging
  State/Effects: reads debug_assistant.md file | creates Agent and RuntimeInspector instances | no writes or global state | inspector has frozen exception frame context
  Integration: exposes create_debug_agent(frame, exception_traceback, model) function | agent gets RuntimeInspector methods as tools via automatic method extraction | used by auto_debug_exception() to analyze crashes
  Performance: one-time setup per exception | loads prompt from file once | inspector methods have minimal overhead
  Errors: FileNotFoundError if prompt file missing | Agent creation errors propagate | model defaults to "o4-mini" for speed | max_iterations=5 for experimentation loops
