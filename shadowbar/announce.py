"""
Purpose: Build and sign ANNOUNCE messages for agent relay network registration
LLM-Note:
  Dependencies: imports from [json, time, typing, address.py] | imported by [agent.py] | tested by [tests/test_announce.py]
  Data flow: receives from Agent.serve() → create_announce_message(address_data, summary, endpoints) → builds message dict without signature → serializes to deterministic JSON (sort_keys=True) → calls address.sign() to create Ed25519 signature → returns signed message ready for relay
  State/Effects: no side effects | pure function | deterministic JSON serialization (matches server verification) | signature is hex string without 0x prefix
  Integration: exposes create_announce_message(address_data, summary, endpoints) | used by Agent.serve() to announce agent presence to relay network | relay server verifies signature using address (public key) | heartbeat re-sends with updated timestamp
  Performance: Ed25519 signing is fast (sub-millisecond) | JSON serialization minimal overhead | no I/O or network calls
  Errors: raises KeyError if address_data missing required keys | address.sign() errors bubble up | no validation of summary length or endpoint format

ShadowBar Announce - Build ANNOUNCE messages for relay registration.

This module provides functions for creating signed ANNOUNCE messages
that agents send to the ShadowBar relay server for registration.
