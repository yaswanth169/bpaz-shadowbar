# Introduction

**ShadowBar** is the Barclays Internal AI agent framework, developed by **Platform Engineering – Team BPAZ**.

It is designed to provide a secure, compliant, and powerful environment for building AI agents that integrate seamlessly with Barclays infrastructure, specifically optimized for the **Anthropic Claude 4.5** model family.

## Why ShadowBar?

ShadowBar was built to solve the unique challenges of deploying AI agents within a regulated financial environment.

*   **Security First**: Built with strict trust levels, network isolation, and comprehensive audit logging.
*   **Barclays Integrated**: Native support for Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Calendar) and internal APIs.
*   **Developer Friendly**: A Pythonic API that feels natural to use, with a powerful CLI (`sb`) for management.
*   **Anthropic Optimized**: Deep integration with Claude's tool use and reasoning capabilities.

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Trust System
A granular trust model that defines exactly what an agent can and cannot do. From read-only access to full autonomous execution, you control the boundaries.

### 🔌 Enterprise Integrations

### 🧩 Plugin Architecture
Extend ShadowBar with custom plugins. Whether it's a new tool, a custom event handler, or a specialized logger, the plugin system makes it easy.

### 🖥️ TUI & Debugging
A rich Terminal User Interface (TUI) for interactive sessions, coupled with powerful debugging tools like the `@xray` decorator and interactive trace inspection.
