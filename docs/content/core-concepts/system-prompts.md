# System Prompts

System prompts define the persona and constraints of your agent.

## Best Practices

*   **Be Specific**: Define the role clearly.
*   **Set Boundaries**: Explicitly state what the agent should NOT do.
*   **Use Markdown**: Structure your prompts for better readability by the LLM.
